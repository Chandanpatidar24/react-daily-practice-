# Day 02 – React Components, Composition & Props

Welcome to Day 02 of my React learning journey using FreeCodeCamp! Today’s focus was on understanding **component composition**, **rendering**, and **passing props**, which are the building blocks of any scalable React app.

---

## 📘 Challenges Completed (FreeCodeCamp React – 9 to 14)

### 1. `Create a Component with Composition`
**File:** `01_ComponentComposition.jsx`  
We created a class component `ParentComponent` and nested a stateless `ChildComponent` inside it using composition. Learned how to pass child components using custom JSX tags.

---

### 2. `Use React to Render Nested Components`
**File:** `02_NestedComponents.jsx`  
We practiced nesting components inside each other — `TypesOfFruit` inside `Fruits`, and then `Fruits` inside `TypesOfFood`. This introduced the idea of deeply nested reusable UIs.

---

### 3. `Compose React Components`
**File:** `03_ComposeComponents.jsx`  
Composed multiple stateless and class components like `NonCitrus`, `Citrus`, and `Fruits` under a `TypesOfFood` parent. Emphasized mixing component types within parent-child structures.

---

### 4. `Render a Class Component to the DOM`
**File:** `04_RenderClassComponent.jsx`  
Used `ReactDOM.render()` to manually render the `TypesOfFood` component into the `div#challenge-node`. This reinforced how React mounts to the DOM using its own API.

---

### 5. `Write a React Component from Scratch`
**File:** `05_MyFirstComponent.jsx`  
Built a complete React class component `MyComponent` from scratch using ES6 syntax and rendered it to the DOM. The output displayed: `My First React Component!`

---

### 6. `Pass Props to a Stateless Functional Component`
**File:** `06_PassPropsToFunction.jsx`  
We passed a `date` prop from a `Calendar` parent to a `CurrentDate` child. Accessed it in a stateless functional component using `props.date`. This was our first step into the props system.
