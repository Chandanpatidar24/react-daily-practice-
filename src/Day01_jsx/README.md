# Day 01 – React Basics & JSX

Welcome to Day 01 of learning React! Today we covered the very foundation: JSX, components, and how React renders elements to the DOM.

---

## 1. `JSXElement`

We created our first JSX element using a basic `<h1>` tag.



---

## 2.`ComplexJSXElement`

We built a JSX structure with multiple nested elements wrapped in a parent `<div>`.


---

## 3.`AddCommentsinJSX`

We added a comment inside JSX using the correct syntax.


---

## 4.`RenderHTMLElementsToDOM`

We used `ReactDOM.render()` to render JSX to a DOM node.



---

## 5.`DefineAnHTMLClassInJSX`

We used `className` instead of `class` in JSX.


---

## 6.`LearnAboutSelfClosingJSXTags`

We correctly closed self-closing tags like `<br />` and `<hr />`.


---

## 7.`CreateAStatelessFunctionalComponent`

We created our first functional component.



---

## 8.`CreateAReactComponent (Class-Based)`

We defined a React component using the ES6 `class` syntax.
